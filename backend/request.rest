When should the fuses be replaced? An internal component malfunction can damage the fuses. You may need to replace the fuses if the generator fails the self-test or if the generator stops functioning, even though it is receiving power from a wall outlet. Refer to the LigaSure Vessel Sealing Generator Service Manual for instructions
